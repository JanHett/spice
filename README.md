## An image processing library.

This is an attempt to provide a set of generic tools for image processing. At the core of the library is a type for storing n-dimensional data. It intends to translate the flexibility of NumPy's and Julia's Arrays into a low-overhead structure matching the design of the existing C++ standard library.

It is also a learning project for me and far from ready for prime-time. Interfaces change frequently, many (all?) things are still inefficient, inconvenient or plain incorrect and there aren't all that many features yet.

With that being said, here's what it does do, though:

## Features

This is just a quick overview. Please refer to the [documentation](https://janhett.github.io/spice/) for more a complete reference and details on the individual types' properties.

### N-Dimensional Container `spice::nd_vector`

Imagine a version of `std::vector` made for storing multidimensional data. Sure, you can nest classic vectors, but each level of nesting will incur an overhead. The other alternative is to use a single vector and access elements like this `vec[x + y * line_length]`. Maybe this is fine for 2D structures if you're used to it, but (IMHO) it gets unwieldy and error-prone quickly.

Instead, here's how to create a 3D `nd_vector`:

```c++
spice::nd_vector<float, 3> three_d({100, 200, 100});
```

You can access elements via the subscript operator or the call operator:

```c++
//												   x   y  z
float element1 = three_d   [42][47][0];
float element2 = three_d   (42, 47, 0);
float element2 = three_d.at(42, 47, 0);
```

Note the order of the indices: x, y, and then z. Data in a `spice::nd_vector` is organised in "column major" order as opposed to the row major order common in C++ and Python. This is to make accessing partial slices intuitive and efficient. It also has the nice side effect that loops nested in the intuitive order are cache-friendly:

```c++
for (int x = 0; x < three_d.shape[0]; ++x)
  for (int y = 0; y < three_d.shape[1]; ++y)
    for (int z = 0; z < three_d.shape[2]; ++z)
      std::cout << three_d(x, y, z);
```

#### A note on the name

I named this structure `nd_vector` because it's closer to a `std::vector` than a `std::array` in that it is a dynamically allocated data structure. I don't love it, though, since vector implies a one-dimensional data structure. Suggestions are welcome.

### View over N-Dimensional slices of `spice::nd_vector`s

Indexing into an `nd_vector` either returns a reference to the stored element (if a full set of coordinates was specified) or a `spice::nd_span` representing a slice of the data.

### Image data structure based on `nd_vector`

Since an image is essentially a three-dimensional array of values (the dimensions being width, height and colour), spice's `image` type is implemented as a subclass of `nd_vector`. It provides a set of additional properties and operations.

### Image processing and analysis tools

#### Blur

##### Fast gaussian blur approximation

#### Noise

##### Salt and Pepper

##### Uniform

##### Gaussian

#### Statistics

##### Histogram

## Building

spice does not yet have a fully fledged cmake/make setup. Setting this up is part of getting the library to a usable state and will happen before a proper release.

For now, there is a Python build script called `./tools/build`. Please run it with `-h` to find out how to use it, it is changing much too frequently to keep this README up to date.

The main library depends on OpenImageIO, the guideline support library (GSL) and nothing else. For unit testing, Google Test is required and to build the documentation, you need Doxygen and m.css.

## Contributing

If you found this project useful enough to add your two cents (or lines of code), please do!

Here's a few ways you can have a part in driving this library forward:

- use it, note what's working and what isn't and tell me about it
- propose a specific fix or - even better...
- submit a pull request

If you're extremely motivated, here's a list of things I think are in need of attention or review:

- the build system
- the inheritance structure of `image`, `nd_vector` and `nd_span`

## History

This is a re-write of a previous project of mine. It attempts to correct some of the design mistakes I made. That being said, it is far from being usable at the moment. In fact, for now it "does" (almost) nothing for the moment. My current goal is to set up the data structures I need to implement actual functionality. I am taking my time with this, because one of the lessons I learned from the predecessor of this project is that data structures make a huge difference for the performance, reliability and usability of a library. Once this basis is established, I will be sure to boast about the added features in the appropriate place (meaning either in the README or in the documentation).

Check out the [documentation](https://janhett.github.io/spice/)Â for a more in-depth look at what this library does. I have also published an [article](https://medium.com/@janhettenkofer/designing-an-efficient-user-friendly-image-data-structure-a24a8aed4a2d?source=friends_link&sk=5c8808dfabcf1841752c1fb3e8916238) about the considerations that went into the `spice::image` data structure.
